For any future site maintainers:

The current year's site can occupy the top-level directory of this repo. Move any pre-existing files into a directory named for the year of those files' event.

Keep `previous.html` in place. Edit it as much as needed, but keep it where it is. Do not copy it into yearly archive directories. As yearly editions of the page get shelved in their own directories, update that year's page's "previous" link to point to the single `previous.html`, and edit that year's link in `previous.html`.
