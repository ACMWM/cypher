					<h2>About Us</h2>
					<p>Cypher VI is the College of William and Mary's annual hackathon. It's an opportunity for students to come together for a weekend and learn new stuff, create cool projects, and win prizes. We pride ourselves on running an event that is accessible and welcoming to everyone, regardless of their skill or experience levels. We hope that Cypher VI will be a place for people to innovate and develop things that they had never considered before. This year our goal is to focus on sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of our hackathon.</p>
