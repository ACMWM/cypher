					<h2>About Us</h2>
					<p>Cypher VI is the College of William and Mary's annual hackathon. It's an opportunity for students to come together for a weekend and learn new stuff, create cool projects, and win prizes. We pride ourselves on running an event that is accessible and welcoming to everyone, regardless of their skill or experience levels. We hope that Cypher VI will be a place for people to innovate and develop things that they had never considered before. This year our goal is to focus on sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of our hackathon.</p>

					<h2>Virtual Hackathon</h2>
					<p>This year, Cypher VI is completely online! We will be using Discord as the main platform for communication for the event and Youtube livestreams will be used for the opening and closing ceremonies, tech talks, and showing off hacks at the end of the hackathon. You can make a Discord account <a href="https://discord.com/register">here</a>. All livestreams will be recorded and available on the Cypher YouTube channel afterwards. </p>
