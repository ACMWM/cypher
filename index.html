					<h2>About Us</h2>
					<p>Cypher VI is the College of William and Mary's annual hackathon. It's an opportunity for students to come together for a weekend and learn new stuff, create cool projects, and win prizes. We pride ourselves on running an event that is accessible and welcoming to everyone, regardless of their skill or experience levels. We hope that Cypher VI will be a place for people to innovate and develop things that they had never considered before. This year our goal is to focus on sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of our hackathon.</p>

			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<h3>Schedule?</h3>
			<p>To be announced!</p>
			<h3>Experience?</h3>
			<p>Anyone and everyone! We will provide workshops for hackers interested in learning something new, and professionals in the industry will be there to mentor you throughout the weekend, if you want.</p>
			<h3>Prizes?</h3>
			<p>To be announced!</p>
			<h3>Age?</h3>
			<p>Any current college student, or anyone who has graduated in the last 12 months is eligible to attend Cypher.</p>
			<h3>Teams?</h3>
			<p>Don't worry if you don't have a team yet. Meeting new people is half the fun - we'll help you find someone to work with! Teams can have a maximum of 4 people.</p>
			<h3>Preparations?</h3>
			<p>Come with ideas, but no code can be written prior to the event.</p>
			<h3>Rules?</h3>
			<p>We want this to be a safe and fun event for everyone. All participants are expected to agree to the <a href="https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf">MLH Code of Conduct.</a></p>
			<h3>Travel Reimbursement?</h3>
			<p>Travel reimbursement requests are assessed on a case by case basis.  A greater number of people traveling together (via carpooling, busing, etc.) will have a positive effect on the amount that we can reimburse.</p>
			<p>We will calculate reimbursement primarily based on mileage. Those requesting reimbursement are asked to provide the number of people traveling with them to Cypher, the method of transportation and number of cars if applicable, and the estimated mileage for a one way trip. We will only fulfill reimbursements after receipts have been provided for each trip.</p>
			<p>We will only cover necessary travel expenses such as gas, fares, etc. Meals will NOT be covered.</p>
			<p>All requests should be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:cypher.wm@gmail.com">cypher.wm@gmail.com</a>. Please submit your requests ahead of time to guarantee that we can review them ahead of time.</p>
			<h3>Other Questions?</h3>
